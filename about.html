                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The project uses multiple resources to help restore lost indigenous narratives of displacement, resilience, and cultural continuity experienced during colonization. By using a mix of western technology and Mohican narratives, this website hopes to impose historical and cultural information onto a colonialist map that fails to acknowledge Mohican territory. The website consists of an interactive digital map that allows a user to explore a trail of points, each containing important connections to Mohican experiences throughout history ranging from colonization to modern day repatriation. The project is meant to inform people on the history of the land they walk on and who it once belonged to, and it hopes to make them reflect and respect it. Mostly, this project serves as a call to action, raising awareness about repatriation efforts and bringing attention to a topic that has been mostly ignored by the majority over the past couple of years. Freshmen who reside on Williams College campus come from all over the world, and this map provides them an opportunity to engage meaningfully with the history  of the land they live on. By recognizing and amplifying these narratives, this project aims to contribute to not just Mohican culture, but cultural preservation in general.
